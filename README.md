# GrainGrowthSoluteDrag

This code deals with anisotropic grain growth simulations in 2D and in 3D for pure and impure materials. To run the code, use ``make`` and ``./GG`` from the main directory. The input file is located in the ``inp`` folder. Create a ``obj`` and ``output`` folder before running the simulation.
